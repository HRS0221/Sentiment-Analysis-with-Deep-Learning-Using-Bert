# This code is a sentiment analysis implementation using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) on a dataset of textual data. Below is a description of the key components of the code:

# Data Preprocessing:
The code starts by reading a CSV file (smile-annotations-final.csv) containing text data with associated sentiment labels. The dataset is cleaned by removing tweets with multiple categories and those labeled as 'nocode'.

# Label Encoding:
Unique labels in the dataset are identified, and a label dictionary is created to map labels to numerical values. The dataset is then updated with a new 'label' column.

# Train-Validation Split:
The dataset is split into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

# Tokenization and Encoding:
The BERT tokenizer (BertTokenizer) is used to tokenize and encode the text data. The encoded data is prepared for both training and validation sets.

# Model Initialization:
A BERT-based sequence classification model (BertForSequenceClassification) is initialized. The model is configured for the number of unique labels in the dataset.

# Data Loaders:
Training and validation data loaders (DataLoader) are created to load batches of data during training efficiently.

# Training Loop:
The model is trained in a loop over a specified number of epochs. The training loop includes forward and backward passes, gradient clipping, and AdamW optimizer optimization. The model is saved after each epoch.

# Evaluation:
The model is loaded after training, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set. The evaluation includes calculating the loss and F1 score.

# Model Loading and Inference:
The saved model is loaded, and its performance is demonstrated by evaluating predictions on the validation set and displaying accuracy per class.

# Dependencies and Environment:
The code specifies dependencies like the torch, pandas, tqdm, and transformers libraries.


# Required Python Version is 3.10.0
If you're using vs code or any other IDE then install the 3.10.0 version and then install the libraries you'll not face any errors then, & don't forget to change the path of the .csv file and the location where you want to save the model.

# Thanks...!
